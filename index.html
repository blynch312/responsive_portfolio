                <img id="image" src="assests/images/patrick.jpg">Hi! My name is Brian Lynch and I am a 26 year old student at UNCC in the Full Stack Development program!
                As a former web designer I was always envious of the skills and talents of the developers that I drew mock-ups
                for. However, I am excited to finally have the chance to become a developer myself and pursue a dream of
                becoming a Full Stack Developer! Born and raised in Wilmington, North Carolina, I enjoyed a life on the coast
                of southern NC. As I got older, I realized there was not much of an opportunity for myself to grow into a
                career that I wanted, so I moved to Charlotte to attend Central Piedmont Community College to study engineering.
                Although I came from a family of Engineers, it never felt right for me as my studies progressed. But after
                learning about the UNC Charlotte Full Stack Boot Camp, I knew this was what I wanted to do. Although this
                course will probably be the hardest thing I have ever done in my life, I am excited to be apart of it and
                look forward to the challenges ahead!</p>
